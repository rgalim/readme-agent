# README

## Project Overview

**readme-agent** is an AI-powered tool designed to automatically generate comprehensive README files for GitHub repositories. By leveraging the capabilities of language models, this tool analyzes the contents of a repository, identifies essential files, and constructs a detailed README. This can significantly enhance the documentation quality of projects, making them more accessible and understandable to contributors and users.

## Installation Instructions

To install the **readme-agent**, ensure you have Python 3.12 or higher installed. You can then install the necessary dependencies using the following steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd readme-agent
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Alternatively, if you are using `setuptools`, you can install the project and its dependencies using:
```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage Examples

To use the **readme-agent**, you need to provide the URL of the GitHub repository for which you want to generate a README. The tool will clone the repository, analyze its contents, and create a README file in a temporary directory.

Here's how you can run the tool:

```bash
python main.py --url <github-repo-url>
```

Replace `<github-repo-url>` with the actual URL of the GitHub repository you want to analyze.

## Configuration and Key Components

### Configuration

The tool requires two environment variables to function correctly:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub personal access token for authenticating API requests.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for accessing language model services.

Ensure these variables are set in your environment before running the tool. You can use a `.env` file to manage these configurations.

### Key Components

1. **GitHubClient**: Handles interactions with GitHub, including cloning repositories. It modifies the repository URL with the provided GitHub token for authentication.

2. **LLMClient**: Manages interactions with the language model, including invoking the model with prompts and validating token counts to ensure they do not exceed limits.

3. **File Utilities**: Includes functions for creating temporary directories, extracting file paths and names, merging file contents, and creating the README file.

4. **Nodes**: Defines the workflow nodes used in the state graph to process the repository and generate the README. Key nodes include:
   - `clone_repo_node`: Clones the repository to a temporary directory.
   - `select_essential_files_node`: Identifies essential files for README generation.
   - `readme_body_node`: Constructs the README content using the language model.
   - `readme_file_node`: Writes the generated README content to a file.

5. **StateGraph**: Utilizes the `langgraph` library to define and manage the workflow of nodes, ensuring a structured process from cloning the repository to generating the README.

By following these instructions and understanding the components, you can effectively use the **readme-agent** to enhance your project's documentation.
